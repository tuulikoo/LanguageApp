## Project Vision

Our vision for LanguageApp is to provide language learners with a fun and motivating way to get started with learning a new language through gamified elements. The learning environment of LanguageApp is specifically designed for beginners in language learning. Its game-like world and features help users progress in their language studies according to their own level.

### Tests

We prioritize the quality and reliability of our application. To ensure its robustness, we employ a combination of testing tools:

- **Robot Framework**: An open-source automation framework that validates not only the application's functionality but also its overall behavior. More details at [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/).

- **Vitest**: A modern test runner for JavaScript. It's optimized for speed and developer experience. More details at [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

- **Playwright**: Provides a set of APIs to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers. With Playwright, we can simulate user actions and ensure that our application works seamlessly across different browsers. More details at [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
